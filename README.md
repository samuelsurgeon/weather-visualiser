# Weather Forecast Visualiser
A weather forecast visualiser that uses OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.

You can access the project here: https://samuelsurgeon.github.io/weather-visualiser/

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to become more familiar with implementing APIs into vanilla JS. I used the OpenWeather API for this project.

## Responsiveness
Please note: The app is ideally desktop only. It should work for any desktop screen size, but will become difficult to read with a screen-size less than 500px.

## Browsers
For best experience use Chrome.

## Credit
I used the OpenWeather API for the weather data, Odometer for the number animations and the IANA Timezone format for retrieving timezones.
